Flying cats
Flying cats

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,100
Cats never fail to fascinate human beings.
猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。
3
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,733
They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, |

4
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,666
but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well.
它们可以对人友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。

5
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:33,066
They never become submissive like dogs and horses.
它们从不像狗和马一样变得那么顺从。

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,600
As a result, |

7
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,533
humans have learned to respect feline independence.
结果是人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。



8
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:43,500
Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives.
在它们的一生中，大多数猫都对人存有戒心。

9
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:51,133
One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives.
最使我们感兴趣的一件事情就是一种通俗的信念——猫有九条命。

10
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:52,933
Apparently, |

11
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,333
there is a good deal of truth in this idea.
显然，这种说法里面包含着许多真实性。

12
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:02,100
A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.
猫在跌落时能够大难不死是有事实作为依据的。


13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,533
Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months.
最近，纽约动物医疗中心对132只猫进行了为期5个月的综合研究。

14
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:16,600
All these cats had one experience in common: |

15
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:19,333
they had fallen off high buildings, |

16
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:23,333
yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries.
所有这些猫都有一个共同的经历：它们都曾从高层建筑上摔下来过，但只有其中的8只猫死于震荡或跌伤。

17
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,866
Of course, |

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,700
New Yorkis the ideal place for such an interesting study, |

19
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:33,200
because there is no shortage of tall buildings. |

20
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,600
There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall, |

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
from!
当然，纽约是进行这种有趣的试验的一个理想的地方，因为那里根本不缺乏高楼大厦，有的是高层的窗槛从上往下坠落。

22
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,666
One cat, Sabrina, |

23
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,100
fell 32 storeys, |

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,833
yet only suffered from a broken tooth.
有一只叫萨伯瑞娜的猫从32层楼上掉下来，但只摔断了一颗牙。


25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,133
‘Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers, |

26
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,633
’ a doctor said.
“猫就像训练有素的跳伞队员，”一位医生说。


27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,066
It seems that the further cats fall, |

28
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,833
the less they are likely to injure themselves.
看起来，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。


29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,700
In a long drop, |

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,400
they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more.
在一个长长的跌落过程中，它们可以达到每小时60英里甚至更快的速度。


31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,266
At high speeds, |

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,966
falling cats have time to relax.
在高速下落中，猫有时间放松自己。


33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,133
They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels.
它们伸展开四肢，就像飞行中的松鼠一样。

34
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:20,300
This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.
这样就加大了空气阻力，并减小了它们着地时冲击力带来的震动。
