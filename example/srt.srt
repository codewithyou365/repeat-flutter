1
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,600
Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, |

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:25,800
but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired.
我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事筹集资金。但始终未能筹足资金把教堂的钟修好。

3
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:35,333
The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.
教堂的钟很大，以前不分昼夜打点报时，但很多年前遭到毁坏，从此便无声无息了。


4
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:37,966
One night, however, |

5
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,200
our vicar woke up with a start: |

6
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,100
the clock was striking the hours!
一天夜里，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了，大钟又在“打点”报时了！

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,700
Looking at his watch, |

8
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,933
he saw that it was one o'clock, |

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,266
but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.
他一看表，才1点钟，可是那钟一边敲了13下才停。


10
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:53,366
Armed with a torch, |

11
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:57,300
the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.
牧师拿着一支电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟发生了什么事情。

12
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,133
In the torchlight, |

13
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:04,233
he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, |

14
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,733
our local grocer.
借着电筒光。他看见一个人，马上认出那是本地杂货店主比尔.威尔金斯。


15
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,533
'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' |

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,466
asked the vicar in surprise.
“你究竟在这上面干什么，比尔？”牧师惊讶地问。

17
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,466
'I'm trying to repair the bell, |

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,533
' answered Bill. |

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,433
'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. |


20
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,100
You see, |

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,933
I was hoping to give you a surprise.|

22
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:21,466
'
“我想把这口钟修好，”比尔回答说。“好几个星期了，我天天夜里到钟楼上来。嗯，我是想让你大吃一惊。”

23
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,500
'You certainly did give me a surprise!|

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
' said the vicar. |

25
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:29,066
'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. |

26
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,066
Still, |

27
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm glad the bell is working again.|

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,366
'
“你确实使我大吃了一惊！”牧师说，“也许同时你把村里所有的人都吵醒了。不过，钟又能报时了，我还是很高兴的。”

29
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,566
'That's the trouble, vicar, |

30
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:35,600
' answered Bill. |

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,000
'It's working all right, |

32
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:43,933
but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.|

33
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,466
'
“问题就在这里，牧师，”比尔回答说。“不错，钟能报时了，但是，恐怕每到1点钟，它总要敲13下，对此我已无能为力了。”

34
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,700
'We'll get used to that, Bill,|

35
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,800
' said the vicar.|

36
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,133
'Thirteen is not as good as one, |

37
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,333
but it's better than nothing. |

38
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:56,033
Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea. |

39
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:56,700
'
“大家慢慢就习惯了，比尔，”牧师说。“13下是不如1下好，但总比1下也不敲强。来，咱们下楼去喝杯茶吧。”
