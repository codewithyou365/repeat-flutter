1
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,000
These days, |

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,166
people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices.
如今，从事体力劳动的人的收入一般要比坐办公室的人高出许多。


3
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:36,066
People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.
坐办公室的之所以常常被称作“白领工人”，就是因为他们通常是穿着硬领白衬衫，系着领带去上班。


4
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,633
Such is human nature, |

5
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:47,533
that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.
许多人常常情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的殊荣，此乃人之常情。


6
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:52,033
This can give rise to curious situations, |

7
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:59,433
as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.
而这常常会引起种种奇怪的现象，在埃尔斯米尔公司当清洁工的艾尔弗雷德.布洛斯就是一个例子。


8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
When he got married, |

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,166
Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job.
艾尔弗结婚时，感到非常难为情，而没有将自己的职业告诉妻子。


10
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,866
He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation.
他只说在埃尔斯米尔公司上班。

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,600
Every morning, |

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,100
he left home dressed in a smart black suit.
每天早晨，他穿上一身漂亮的黑色西装离家上班，



13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,333
He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.
然后换上工作服，当8个小时清洁工。


14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,733
Before returning home at night. |

15
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:28,466
He took a shower and changed back into his suit.
晚上回家前，他洗个淋浴，重新换上那身黑色西服。


16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,133
Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, |

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,166
for Alf has just found another job. |

18
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,033
He will soon be working in an office.
两年多以来，艾尔弗一直这样，他的同事也为他保守秘密。艾尔弗的妻子一直不知道她嫁给了一个清洁工，而且她永远也不会知道了，因为艾尔弗已找到薪职，不久就要坐办公室里工作了。

19
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,066
He will be earning only half as much as he used to, |


20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,566
but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money.
他将来挣的钱只有他现在的一半。不过他觉得，地位升高了，损失点儿钱也值得。

21
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,166
From now on, |

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,366
he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. |

23
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,566
Bloggs', not 'Alf'.
从此，艾尔弗可以一天到晚穿西服了。别人将称呼他为“布洛格斯先生”，而不再叫他“艾尔弗”了。
