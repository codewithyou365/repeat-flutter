00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,333
thank you so much you're welcome thank you

3
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:04,933
I think it's right over there

4
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,900
go straight and turn right

5
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,500
clear room and you can see the staff here

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,600
awful thank you so much

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,400
thank you

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,333
that the immigration process was very easy

9
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,766
it's incredibly modern

10
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:16,966
heartlessly clean

11
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,200
this is one of the best

12
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,500
first impressions so far of a country that we've had

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,100
clean fast

14
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,966
affordable and easy to use

15
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,333
welcome to Chengdu

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,000
just about enough space I think got it

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,866
hello everybody and

18
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,600
good morning from

19
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,366
Bangkok Thailand Today

20
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,700
we're heading to a country that neither of us

21
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,866
know very much about

22
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,900
we only have preconceptions that we have been taught

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,333
from western media from western education

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,300
we know basically zero about where we're heading to

25
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,566
but nonetheless it's a new country

26
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:59,000
it's the beginning of a new adventure

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,866
and we're very very excited

28
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,200
to head to China

29
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,333
super excited

30
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,166
also a little bit nervous like I'm not gonna lie

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
first time going to China

32
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,866
and yeah

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,533
let's just get on a plane and see what it's like

34
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:20,100
we're all checked in and we are ready

35
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,000
to fly to Chengdu

36
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:23,900
very very exciting

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,066
right you guys I hope you can hear me

38
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,100
we're just about to arrive at Chengdu and it seems like

39
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,533
a lot of Chengdu might have

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,700
burning season still going because you can see

41
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,266
dotted along the

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,133
landscape sort of

43
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,333
fires burning here and there

44
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,966
I'm not really sure if there's a

45
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,933
burning season or if that's just a

46
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,933
usual situation in Chengdu

47
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,600
maybe that the farmers are doing

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know but it looks

49
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:03,300
very interesting and so different as well from

50
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,966
what the the landscape that we are usually used to so

51
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,533
both of us are very excited

52
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,900
um a little bit nervous I'm not gonna lie

53
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,866
because obviously it's our first time to China

54
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,933
neither of us speak

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Chinese or we Chinese so it's gonna be

56
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,933
I think challenging but very very beautiful

57
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,966
welcome to Tianfu International Airport in Chengdu

58
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:27,866
China

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
I never thought that I would say that sentence

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,000
no

61
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,566
we're in mainland

62
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,933
we're in mainland China guys so

63
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,000
first time and

64
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,933
we're gonna be here for a couple weeks

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,400
we have a lot to learn we have a lot to explore

66
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:44,933
well

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,800
to get your immigration still

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,266
so we're not even sure if we're actually in yet

69
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:50,733
look

70
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,733
we'll see what happens

71
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,400
first impressions as well is it's really cold

72
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,200
so

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,066
it seems to be just like 20 degrees Celsius right now

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,400
and we just came from 39 degrees Celsius Bangkok so

75
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,366
19 degrees difference

76
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,566
I don't know I'm very cold

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,666
just just picked up our bags guys

78
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,100
I can barely even speak because of how excited I am

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,566
we have our stamp and we have just entered

80
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,900
and have our first couple of footsteps

81
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,300
in China

82
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,766
so yeah that's a pretty crazy we cannot believe this

83
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,066
next up we need to figure out

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,333
now we're going to take the metro

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,566
from here to where we want to stay we have no idea

86
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,666
where we're going what we're doing

87
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,500
this airport by the way Tianfu International

88
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,933
I believe it's quite new

89
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,366
it's incredibly modern

90
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,600
spotlessly clean and I have to say

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,900
that the immigration process was very easy

92
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,966
yeah that's what I wanted to say immigration was

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
relatively easy for us

94
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,700
the people spoke English

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,666
everything was fine we just had to fill out

96
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,800
a little card like this basically

97
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,766
which you have to carry afterwards with you

98
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,200
you presented

99
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,866
no questions asked just kind of where are you going

100
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,200
what are you doing and was it

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,333
yep we're in very very straightforward

102
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:10,766
quite literally took around 10 minutes and yeah

103
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:13,066
we're in China so let's go and figure out

104
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,366
how to take this metro

105
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,300
and how to work

106
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,733
everything

107
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,400
as we just downloaded before we left Bangkok

108
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,333
we downloaded

109
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,000
Alipay and a couple of other different things

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,300
so yeah we're gonna see how that all works

111
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,500
we're also on the look for a SIM card so

112
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,466
SIM card SIM card

113
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,066
a lot of things that we have to check

114
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,800
check off basically

115
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,400
so yeah let's go into China

116
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,533
welcome to Chengdu

117
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:40,100
I love it look at the pandas

118
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:43,900
now

119
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,000
we're gonna be documenting quite literally everything

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,966
for you guys just in case

121
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:51,000
you are also planning on coming to China

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,066
and you might be very confused like we are

123
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,566
so we're gonna try and take cash out

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,666
now I know cash is not typically widely used here

125
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:06,100
in China it's mostly Alipay and Wechat and a lot of

126
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,166
sort of QR code payment systems

127
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,966
digitalized payment systems

128
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:11,333
we're gonna try

129
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
and take some cash out and see if that's an option

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,366
for us

131
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:18,300
because we have heard that you can use cash in certain

132
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
circumstances

133
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
and we're not too sure if our Alipay works just yet

134
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,766
so

135
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,500
let's see if our visa works

136
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:31,100
online we read at sort of every ATM purposes

137
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,733
please pay attention to your surroundings

138
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,666
please make sure the surroundings are safe

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
before entering your password

140
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,866
oh it's giving instructions

141
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,800
please select the service entry withdrawal

142
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,866
please select or enter the amount take out

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,900
500 yuan

144
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,933
the transaction transaction is being processed

145
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:58,933
please wait

146
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,100
this is the most nerve working part

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,933
oh my gosh it's doing something

148
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:03,966
oh it's counting

149
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,600
working

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I think it works

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,100
oh my God

152
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,000
I was so scared that we're not gonna be able to use it

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,366
it's working I think

154
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:12,866
very very cool

155
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,500
we have 500

156
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,700
Chinese Yuan

157
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,500
very very interesting looking currency that's for sure

158
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,566
amazing so first step of entering China complete

159
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,133
this is going a lot easier than I thought it would be

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
and we weren't even charged commission

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,366
there you go

162
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,066
so that's amazing

163
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,333
so believe it or not we have a SIM card now

164
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,600
sorted that out so that's another thing

165
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,100
off the checklist

166
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,766
very very easy unbelievably easy actually so far

167
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,933
and now we're making our way to the metro

168
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,733
so we need to take the metro to get into the center

169
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400

okay cool thank you so much

198
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,700
I think it's right over there

199
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,100
go straight and turn

200
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,900
right

201
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
there is

202
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,066
a several small room

203
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,300
yeah it's clear room and you can see the staff there

204
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,600
oh thank you so much

205
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,400
have a nice day

206
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,333
have a nice day

207
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,966
really good English as well

208
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,333
this is one of the best

209
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,466
first impressions so far of a country that we've had

210
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:33,733
and

211
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,200
it's very interesting because the

212
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,366
general perception

213
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,766
of China in the west

214
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,466
I don't need to tell you

215
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,400
it's a overwhelmingly negative

216
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,666
let's put it that way from the media

217
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:52,700
and from a lot of other institutions so

218
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,066
this is the whole reason

219
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,066
why we decided to come to this country

220
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,333
because we wanted to see

221
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:00,800
exactly what it's like for ourselves

222
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:01,966
and we're already

223
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,733
getting on to a very positive

224
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,866
first experience so that's very interesting

225
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,900
gonna go over and buy some metro tickets

226
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,766
with the cash that we got out from the ATM

227
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,566
we still need to figure out what station

228
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,800
we need to change though

229
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,466
yeah true that's very nice

230
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,566
but we only know it in Chinese characters

231
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,466
so I don't know

232
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,266
I cannot read

233
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:25,866
it this one

234
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,200
let's see oh

235
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,966
it worked off

236
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,900
wow the lady had said that

237
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,066
it wasn't possible to play with Alipay

238
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,166
but we just played with Alipay

239
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,400
we just played with Alipay it was really easy

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,566
two tickets to Line 18

241
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,133
was really affordable too

242
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:51,000
super affordable at €2

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,733
30 for both of us nice

244
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,766
let's go and take the Chengdu Metro

245
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,000
for the very first time

246
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,866
surprisingly bilingual

247
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,466
I was really scared that we were gonna arrive and not

248
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
understand anything but it's like

249
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
just perfect you can really like reach pretty much

250
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,933
anything that is going on

251
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,900
and you don't even need a translator

252
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,166
I was really scared because

253
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,400
obviously it's difficult to access Google Translate

254
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,333
and that's like that

255
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,200
so I was like

256
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I don't know if we're even

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,900
gonna manage to get somewhere

258
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:23,766
but

259
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,866
everything is boiling it's also in English so it's fun

260
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,900
yeah it's incredible it's

261
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,300
really really straightforward and easy

262
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,400
so nervous for no reason at all

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,933
kind of I feel literally at least so far

264
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,600
maybe there is gonna be a reason leader

265
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,300
where we're headed to is right here

266
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,900
small

267
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,400
south railway station of Chengdu

268
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,800
yeah guys this is the

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,566
Chengdu Metro incredibly incredibly clean

270
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,066
fast

271
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,366
affordable and easy to use

272
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,166
so there you go

273
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,766
let's see how long it takes

274
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,733
us to get from where we were to the

275
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,466
station that we want to go to

276
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,133
okay guys we're just transferring from

277
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,700
one line to the other line

278
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,900
and I do believe we need to go here to the

279
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,166
left side it's a little bit uh

280
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,566
it's not complicated

281
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,666
it's just I think difficult to understand

282
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,600
because obviously it's our first time

283
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,533
uh using the Metro lines here so

284
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,166
yeah we're sort of a little bit overwhelmed we need to

285
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,466
uh go all the way to rem them North Road

286
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,066
just here

287
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,800
and that's where we're gonna change into the No. 6

288
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,300
so that's the way it works by the way we did it wrong

289
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
we just bought a ticket

290
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,500
for uh one train but I believe

291
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,133
you can just buy the ticket for all of the trains

292
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,066
uh towards the end station that you need to

293
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,400
go to and then not get in and out of the street

294
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,533
of the station basically

295
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,566
so yeah just buy one ticket

296
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:57,733
get on a train

297
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
and that it's gonna do what they're doing

298
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,100
wow okay

299
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,500
apparently we're on the right path now

300
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,566
so we just need to basically find eggs today

301
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,966
but after 3 trains swapping between those three trains

302
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel like we're on the right path

303
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,166
we're nearly there and we are ready to check in so

304
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,733
let's see where we end up

305
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,466
we're gonna go towards

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Exit A

307
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,500
of wherever we are right now

308
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,766
and find

309
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,566
exactly where we need to go give you guys a room tour

310
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,366
of the accommodation that we're gonna be staying at

311
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,900
in Chengdu very very excited to have a bed

312
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:51,333
some nice AC maybe and also

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,866
head out for some food or we're gonna save that

314
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
for the next little video for you guys

315
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,866
we're gonna give you a nice room tour nonetheless

316
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,266
also if you guys are foreigners arriving into China

317
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,366
make sure to get a

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,733
description of the path that you have to take

319
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:11,500
in your own scriptures or in our case English

320
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,733
because if it wasn't wouldn't have been for the hostel

321
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,900
I think we would have been completely lost

322
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,300
we

323
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,900
just checked in so

324
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,733
our room exists

325
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,533
our room exists

326
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,000
our accommodation exists everything exists

327
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,533
let's see what it's like

328
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
ta da

329
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,800
welcome to our room in Chengdu China

330
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,666
wow we're going to turn on dead lights

331
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,466

332
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,700
we need lights oh she turned it off here you go

333
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,800
okay welcome to our room

334
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:47,933
central

335
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,666
Chengdu China Sichuan wow

336
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,166
so this is our bathroom

337
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,400
it's kind of like an artsy hipster

338
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,066
type of a hostel type of situation going on here

339
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,400
but we do have a private room so that's nice

340
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
this is the bathroom it's actually very clean

341
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,200
tiling on the wall here that's kind of nice

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,466
then you do have

343
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,333
very nice looking shower

344
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,700
you've got like a rainfall head shower situation

345
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,966
there's me in the mirror

346
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,466
you also have

347
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,300
the usual sink

348
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:27,266
hair dryer etc etc

349
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,800
and oh we have a kettle

350
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,200
over there that's super nice

351
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
yes

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,566
two beds which is fine

353
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,900
we not sure if we can move them together but each one

354
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,100
is big enough to

355
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,200
kind of like two double beds actually

356
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:47,366
I like the lighting situation as well

357
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,200
it's pretty chill and mellow

358
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,466
did you open the window

359
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,366
no it was open

360
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,300
oh okay cool nice

361
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,400
so at least we have some airflow coming into the room

362
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,466
it looks like a really new AC

363
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,200
it looks like a brand new AC that's true this

364
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
hotel in general is kind of I think

365
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:06,800
relatively new

366
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,333
and that's what it looks like

367
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,666
it looks like it was only recently sort of

368
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,100
constructed together

369
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:15,533
and it has like like I said kind of like a hipster art

370
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,533
type of a vibe

371
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,666
like they just kind of put this board

372
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:22,266
wall together and made it into a lighting situation

373
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,166
the bed looks very very clean

374
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,600
and also soft

375
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,666
it's nice and soft too yeah it's a

376
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,900
lot of times we get these like really hard

377
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,000
beds that are

378
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,900
I don't know for my back

379
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,533
not so great

380
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,900
like unmanageable for my back so this one is really

381
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,800
nice and apparently there's also a washing machine and

382
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,366
a free gym which

383
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
which I would

384
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,133
like to have a look at

385
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,800
and then also what I want to say here in

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,366
Chengdu it really seems like

387
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,333
air quality is really really good very positive

388
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,566
um we actually came out of the m R t

389
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,466
and we took a deep breath in and it just

390
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,533
it felt really nice

391
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,566
and I actually I saw that beforehand on Google and

392
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:04,133
and I

393
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,200
didn't really want to believe it because I thought okay

394
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
there's gonna be

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,133
a lot of people a lot of um

396
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,066
traffic a lot of cars and so on

397
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,366
like the typical things

398
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,066
that you would think about when you think China but

399
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,300
not in this area

400
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:18,766
in this area you have

401
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,000
very nice air everything is very laid back

402
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,300
it's not crowded

403
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,900
it seems super beautiful outside

404
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,866
and the temperatures are actually nice as well

405
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,166
so I'm super happy

406
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,200
very true we were just talking about this outside

407
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,600
I think we made the right choice

408
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,800
with our first stop so Chengdu as our very first

409
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,500
city to experience China

410
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,166
I think if we picked Beijing or Shanghai

411
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,500
or one of these

412
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,100
very large mega cities

413
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,533
Chengdu is a very large city in itself

414
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,566
but it seems to be relatively

415
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:54,866
laid back in comparison to a lot of those other cities

416
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,900
it's also known as a Park City so there's plenty of

417
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:02,533
public spaces plenty of parks plenty of nature

418
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,066
when we were landing on the plane

419
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,533
how to look out the window

420
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,200
and all you could see was green

421
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:09,733
so yeah

422
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,733
there's plenty of beautiful nature around

423
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,700
for us to check out

424
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,066
which is our favorite

425
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,300
we're very excited to try some Chinese food

426
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,566
meet some Chinese locals

427
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:19,766
we already met some

428
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
today in the airport as you guys saw

429
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,166
so so far

430
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:29,100
the experience that we're having genuine is incredible

431
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,366
this is not us just putting this on

432
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,566
if we run into negative stuff

433
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,466
we're gonna share it with you guys as well

434
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,866
so keep that in mind

435
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,400
we're gonna be 100 percent honest to build this trip

436
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,100
AC works

437
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,133
I think so yeah

438
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,600
I just don't know what I can hear it

439
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,766
we don't even need an AC

440
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,266
I'm not used to this anymore

441
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,266
yeah that's very true

442
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:48,966
just turn it off

443
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:49,766
I don't know

444
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:53,600
it said yeah it's not that warm it's only like I think

445
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:54,533
roughly

446
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,466
18 well

447
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:01,266
so we just came from Bangkok where it's 37 to 38 to

448
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,066
sometimes 40 plus

449
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,200
coming here to Chengdu it's a breath of pressure

450
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,166
and yeah China

451
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,333
you are very positively surprising us so far

452
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,533
Alipay works incredibly well

453
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
it works with everything

454
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
we just paid for our room with Alipay

455
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,700
which I cannot understand

456
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,900
the app itself has

457
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
everything it has taxis it has

458
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,300
map function it has just

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,766
literally everything in one

460
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:32,366
I can also order food on there as you can order food

461
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,000
yeah so

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
it's kind of like a one size fits all

463
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,933
type of situation

464
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:40,866
it's made everything very streamlined for us so far

465
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,333
our whole experience

466
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,566
to be honest when we were lying in bed last night

467
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,766
before we came here

468
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,133
both of us were saying to each other

469
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,133
so scared we're not going to be able to use

470
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,900
anything that we're used to using

471
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,766
can't use things like

472
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,200
Google for example

473
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,533
you can't use a lot of the

474
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,766
regular apps that the western people are used to using

475
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,000
so we were like how are we gonna navigate around

476
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
we're gonna get lost

477
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,366
we're gonna get stuck we're gonna get

478
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,066
we're not gonna be able to take money out

479
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,100
we're not gonna be able to do any of these things

480
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,366
what we can

481
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,766
so we didn't really have to stress out for much

482
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,733
we took quite a bit of cash out as you saw

483
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,933
we took like 500

484
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,333
note I think and

485
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,100
we didn't use a single one of them yet

486
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,933
actually I thought that we would

487
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,566
run into issues immediately

488
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,666
and having to use cash basically

489
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,866
the second that we hit the Metro but

490
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,000
that was not the case

491
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,566
no need and yeah we have

492
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,466
had zero issues so far

493
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,733
other than us

494
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,300
just not understanding how the metro line

495
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,800
and how big the metro line is

496
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,666
that confused us a good bit

497
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,666
I'm not gonna lie

498
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,366
it's just because of the size of it and Chengdu is big

499
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,266
so we have a lot to get used to

500
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,400
and we have plenty more videos coming your way

501
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,533
where we are going to be

502
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,400
getting used to everything in China

503
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,700
over the next while

504
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,866
so I hope you guys

505
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,100
will tag along with us for that because yeah

506
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
we've got plenty of videos coming at you

507
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,266
super super excited

508
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,133
and also of course

509
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,000
a little bit nervous because a new country

510
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,966
a new language

511
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,133
a new culture

512
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,333
a lot of things to learn so yeah

513
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:13,966
I'm like very positively excited and positively nervous

514
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:14,600
yeah

515
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,966
we're literally in a country that our entire

516
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:20,900
literal entire part of the world tells

517
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:21,933
us never to go to

518
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,966
yeah and that is a pretty crazy feeling

519
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,766
and yeah we need to come to terms with that

520
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:29,133
and you're gonna hopefully join us as we

521
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,900
show you guys the real

522
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,666
sort of down toward version as to what this country is

523
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,100

524
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,166
